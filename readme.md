# Fingerprint Scanning Project

This project uses the Digital Persona U.are.U SDK for fingerprint scanning. It is built with C# and .NET 4.5.

## Modules

The project consists of two modules:

1. **Register**: This module is used for scanning and saving fingerprint data in a MySQL database.
2. **Verify**: This module scans a person's fingerprints, crossmatches it with every data present in the database, and fetches the result of the matched user.

## Usage

The project runs with two parameters:

1. The module name (either "Verify" or "Register").
2. The user_id against which the data will be saved and matched.

For example:

```bash
dotnet run -- Verify 12345
```

## Dependencies

The project uses NuGet packages for MySQL, MySQL Data, and MySQL Client for connecting with MySQL databases, such as XAMPP and Laragon.

## Installation

Please ensure that you have .NET 4.5 and MySQL installed on your machine. Then, clone this repository and install the necessary NuGet packages.
